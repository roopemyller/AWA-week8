## Advanced Web Applications course Week8 task - Reddit copy

The goal was to create a simplified version of a Reddit like forum application, where user can create a new topic and other users can see posts.
All users can see the posts, but only registered users can create new posts. Only admins can remove posts.

Some features:
- Express web application with MongoDB database.
- Registration and login (bcrypt.js, jsonwebtoken)
- Input validation (express-validator)
- Front end (MaterializeCSS)
